## __Lucky Diamonds Casino: BlackJack__
### __Project Description__
__*Scope and Functionality*__ - This program is a standard game of BlackJack (also known as "21").\
The goal is to have a score as close to 21 as you can without going over, while also beating the Dealer's score./
On your turn, you may:
- __Hit:__ Pick up another card
- __Stand:__ Play the hand (ie. the score) you currently have
- __Double Down:__ Double your bet and complete your hand by picking up a single card
Payout rules are displayed on the table in the game.

__*Motivation*__ - Allows me to demonstrate and test my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by applying the concepts learned through my program at UofA.
